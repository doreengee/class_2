1. Print the sum of 2 numbers
2. Print the difference of 2 numbers
3. write 3 lines of code that ask a user for their name, stores the name and
 prints it out
 4. Define two variables and print them
 5. Define two variables and print them using concatenation
 6. Which of the following are operators, and which are values?

 7. What is an expression made up of? What do all expressions do?
 8. This chapter introduced assignment statements, like spam = 10 . What is
   the difference between an expression and a statement?
 9.What does the variable bacon contain after the following code runs?
    bacon = 20
    bacon + 1

 11. What three functions can be used to get the integer, floating-point
    number, or string version of a value?
 12. Why does this expression cause an error? How can you fix it?
   'I have eaten ' + 99 + ' burritos.'
 13. Write a function named collatz() that has one parameter named number . If
number is even, then collatz() should print number // 2 and return this value.
If number is odd, then collatz() should print and return 3 * number + 1 .
Then write a program that lets the user type in an integer and that keeps
calling collatz() on that number until the function returns the value 1 .
(Amazingly enough, this sequence actually works for any integer—sooner
or later, using this sequence, you’ll arrive at 1! Even mathematicians aren’t
sure why. Your program is exploring what’s called the Collatz sequence, some-
times called “the simplest impossible math problem.”)
Remember to convert the return value from input() to an integer with
the int() function; otherwise, it will be a string value.
Hint: An integer number is even if number % 2 == 0 , and it’s odd if
number % 2 == 1 .
